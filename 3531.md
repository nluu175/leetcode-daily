# 3531. Count Covered Buildings

- Given a list of building, check how many covered buildings
- A building is covered if there is at least one building in all 4 directions: LEFT, RIGHT, ABOVE, BELOW
- Input
```python
n = 3
buildings = [[1,2],[2,2],[3,2],[2,1],[2,3]]
```

- Output is 1 
---
- My initial idea is build a hash for each x or y coordinate:
- For example: `x_coords = { 1: [1, 2, 3]}` where key is the x coordinate and value is the list of existing y coordinates. Same for `y_coords`.
- Then check for each coordinate
- Time complexity is O(n) for building hash and O(n) for checking
	- If not smaller than the first and larger than the last, it's covered in that horizontal/vertical axis
	- Must be true for both axis to be covered
- **Can we check as we go?**
